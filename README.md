Small ts practice. Making zoo emulator with interfaces, separating files, and unit test.

For testing I use jest - https://jestjs.io
For typescript - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html

For compiling project, go to src folder and execute (tsc --outDir ../destination)
To execute compiled files, go to destination folder, src folder and execute (node filename.js)
